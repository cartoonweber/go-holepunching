UDP NAT Traversal (also known as UDP firewall hole-punching) is, in effect, identical to port-forwarding for clients behind something like your home’s router; it is a networking technique which allows NAT’d devices to see incoming and unsolicited connections from outside clients via UDP, a connectionless and message-oriented transport protocol, without any special network configuration.
